# MemoryChain - Decentralized Memory Palace on Bitcoin

## Vision
Create a permanent, decentralized repository of human knowledge and family memories that can be passed down through generations with the security and permanence of Bitcoin.

## What is MemoryChain?
MemoryChain enables families to store, encrypt, and inherit their most precious memories across generations, secured by Bitcoin's immutability through Stacks.

### Key Features
- 🔒 **Encrypted Memory Storage** - Photos, documents, videos, letters
- 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 **Family Access Control** - Role-based permissions
- ⏰ **Time-Locked Memories** - Reveal on specific dates
- 🔄 **Inheritance System** - Multi-generational transfer
- 🌐 **Decentralized** - Built on Stacks, secured by Bitcoin

## Technology Stack
- **Blockchain**: Stacks (Bitcoin Layer 2)
- **Smart Contracts**: Clarity
- **Frontend**: React.js with Stacks.js
- **Storage**: IPFS for files, on-chain for metadata
- **Security**: Client-side encryption
